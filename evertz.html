                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my eight months as a student design engineer I worked on various projects such as <a href="http://evertz.com/solutions/vistalink">VistaLINK PRO</a> (VLPro), internal web tools, and some new products. VLPro is Java based wich allowed me to gain more experience in the language and learn a few tricks from my team lead. My first tasks were mainly debugging issues reported by customers and engineers as I become more familar with the software I moved on to adding features such as graphing cababilities and custom web frames. Adding the graphing support allowed for real time data analytics, I worked with an engineering team to support their hardware along with a product team to build the component to their needs. Another major project I worked on was a new Web Based product. This was written in Angular 2+ and allowed me to branch off into a new area of development where I didn't have much experience. The last project I worked on was a license management tool allowing customers to better control the licenses running on their hardware. <br/><br/>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the languages listed I really only new Java at the begining. Throught the work term I ended up learning a ton of new languages and becoming much more experienced with Java. With Java I learned about lambda expressions, streams and async logic using rxJava. Overall my time at Evertz contributed to me becoming a much stronger programmer and really expanded my cababilities related to web devlopment.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Evertz I had a few goals in mind for the 8 months I was there. My first goal was to gain experience in web devlopment. More specifically I wanted to learn how to use HTML / CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript. After working with those I wanted to branch out and try a Javascript framework. At Evertz I had the opertunity to on various web products starting off with a basic information page that allowed me to get a footing with HTML /CSS. Over time I was given bigger and more complex tasks building up my knowledge of Javascript and eventually helped build a new project written in angular 2+. I succeded in this goal and have become much more confident in my web development capabilities.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second goal was to gain more experience in java and learn Spring Boot. In the begging I spent a few weeks dealing with bugs in order to become familar with VistaLINK PRO. While doing this I encountered things I hadn't seen before such as lambda expressions and streams. I spent a little time learning these as they become very useful in tasks later on. This new experience lead me to getting into async and parallel programming later on. As for Spring Boot I eventually picked this up later on in the coop term when I was tasked to make some back end modifications to a new web based product. I now believe I am a much stronger Java devloper because of my time with Evertz.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last goal at Evertz was to gain a better understanding of my surrounding and how my work effects others. Over time I had the opportunity to work with product specialist and hardware engineers across multiple projects where I gained a better understanding of how my work integrates with other teams. Another big part of this was UI updates, part of my work dealt with creating / updating the web UI. Small CSS changes had to applied across the company to maintains a consistent UI. happy with where I ended at wit Evertz as it became much more apparent how certain changes would break features used by other teams.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion I had a lot of fun at Evertz and gained a ton of knowledge. This co-op allowed me to branch into web devlopment and build up experience with many new technologies. I was able to push my self further and had the opportunity to apply what I learned in class. I also gained a lot of experience with team dynamics and leared how large teams work together. While at evertz I was lucky enough to be included in a few events such as the ice man challange (jumping in a pool of ice), trampolining and the company christmas party. All of these were a great way to get to know my team and I will defiently miss them. Overall Evertz has prepared me with a lot of the skills I'll need in the computer science field looking forward and am very thankful to have had the opportunity to work for them.
