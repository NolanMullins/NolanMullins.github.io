                                <h3>My Job</h3>
                                <p>
                                        During my eight months as a student design engineer I worked on various projects such as VistaLINK PRO (VLPro),
                                         internal web tools, and some new products.
                                          VLPro is Java based which allowed me to gain more experience in the language and learn a few tricks from my team lead.
                                           My first tasks were mainly debugging issues reported by customers and engineers as I become more familiar with the software I moved on to adding features such as graphing capabilities and custom web frames.
                                            Adding the graphing support allowed for real time data analytics, I worked with an engineering team to support their hardware along with a product team to build the component to their needs.
                                             Another major project I worked on was a new Web Based product. This was written in Angular 2+ and allowed me to branch off into a new area of development where I didn't have much experience.
                                              The last project I worked on was a license management tool allowing customers to better control the licenses running on their hardware.

                                <p>I had a lot of fun at Evertz and gained a ton of knowledge.
                                     This co-op allowed me to branch into web development and build up experience with many new technologies.
                                      I was able to push my self further and had the opportunity to apply what I learned in class.
                                       I also gained a lot of experience with team dynamics and learned how large teams work together.
                                        While at Evertz I was lucky enough to be included in a few events such as the ice man challenge (jumping in a pool of ice),
                                         trampolining and the company Christmas party. All of these were a great way to get to know my team and I will defiantly miss them.
                                          Overall Evertz has prepared me with a lot of the skills I'll need in the computer science field looking forward and am very thankful to have had the opportunity to work for them.
