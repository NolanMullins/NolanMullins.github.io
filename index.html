                                        During my eight months as a student design engineer I worked on various projects such as VistaLINK PRO (VLPro),
                                         internal web tools, and some new products.
                                          VLPro is Java based which allowed me to gain more experience in the language and learn a few tricks from my team lead.
                                           My first tasks were mainly debugging issues reported by customers and engineers as I become more familiar with the software I moved on to adding features such as graphing capabilities and custom web frames.
                                            Adding the graphing support allowed for real time data analytics, I worked with an engineering team to support their hardware along with a product team to build the component to their needs.
                                             Another major project I worked on was a new Web Based product. This was written in Angular 2+ and allowed me to branch off into a new area of development where I didn't have much experience.
                                              The last project I worked on was a license management tool allowing customers to better control the licenses running on their hardware.
