                                        Evertz Microsystems is a Canadian developer and manufacturer of broadcasting equipment.
                                        Their main headquarters is based in Burlington, Ontario with other offices in the United States,
                                         United Kingdom, Germany, United Arab Emirates, India, Hong Kong, China, Singapore, and Australia.
                                          They currently employ over 2000 people at their head office.
                                           Evertz specializes in delivering end to end broadcasting solutions with systems for content creation to distribution.
                                            They currently deliver content to television, on demand services, IPTV and mobile.

                                <h3>My Job</h3>
                                <p>
                                        During my eight months as a student design engineer I worked on various projects such as VistaLINK PRO (VLPro),
                                         internal web tools, and some new products.
                                          VLPro is Java based which allowed me to gain more experience in the language and learn a few tricks from my team lead.
                                           My first tasks were mainly debugging issues reported by customers and engineers as I become more familiar with the software I moved on to adding features such as graphing capabilities and custom web frames.
                                            Adding the graphing support allowed for real time data analytics, I worked with an engineering team to support their hardware along with a product team to build the component to their needs.
                                             Another major project I worked on was a new Web Based product. This was written in Angular 2+ and allowed me to branch off into a new area of development where I didn't have much experience.
                                              The last project I worked on was a license management tool allowing customers to better control the licenses running on their hardware.

                                <p>I had a lot of fun at Evertz and gained a ton of knowledge.
                                     This co-op allowed me to branch into web development and build up experience with many new technologies.
                                      I was able to push my self further and had the opportunity to apply what I learned in class.
                                       I also gained a lot of experience with team dynamics and learned how large teams work together.
                                        While at Evertz I was lucky enough to be included in a few events such as the ice man challenge (jumping in a pool of ice),
                                         trampolining and the company Christmas party. All of these were a great way to get to know my team and I will definitely miss them.
                                          Overall Evertz has prepared me with a lot of the skills I'll need in the computer science field looking forward and am very thankful to have had the opportunity to work for them.

                            <p>While working at Cascination I mainly focused on Ultrasound navigation to aid cancer ablation needles. 
                                My main task was to overhaul the user interface of the system in order to improve the usability of the system.
                                To do this we completely gutted the front end Qt and stripped out the view logic. While doing this one of the most 
                                important aspects of the project was to deliver a rock solid solution as we cannot afford to have a software issue during a surgery. 
                                We used extensive unit testing and integrated them with our build system (Jenkins) to verify each pull request before merging into master.

                                Since I had the opportunity to work abroad I wanted to experience some of the different lifestyles lead outside of Canada. 
                                This came naturally over time and as I travelled to other countries in Europe and overall learned so much and had a lot of fun in the process.
                                Also before coming to Cascination I hadn't worked in c++ before (just c) and wanted to strengthen my understanding of it. This was a bit tricky 
                                at first but after I got the hang of the new standard libraries and objects I didn't have any issues working with it. Lastly I wanted to become 
                                more independent as I think its an important life skill. This was definitely my most challenging goal and at times it was hard being 6000km away from 
                                home. One way of improving was my solo trips to France and Italy where I was really forced to figure out issues on my own. Overall I had an unforgettable experience 
                                and learned so much.

                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>Working for Cascination was amazing and the 8 months I had flew by. I got to work with a fantastic team of super talented people from different backgrounds.
                                 I truly enjoyed the work I was given and also had a great time outside of work with coworkers when we went hiking, rafting the Aare and they even taught me to ski. 
                                 If any of you ever read this, thanks for everything :)
